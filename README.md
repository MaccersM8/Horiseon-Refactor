# Refactoring Horiseon Web Page

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to refactor and edit the code of the Horiseon Social Solution Services web page to make it more accessible for potential users who have disabilities and utilise the functionality of a screen reader. In addition to this, the aim was to "tidy" up the code and make it more concise and readable for other developers who potentially may access this page. Furthermore, a by-product of this activity is that a fully accessible webpage will increase performance on search engines, reaching a wider audience. Throughout this project/challenge, I have learnt how to use semantic HTML and the best practices that come along with this as well as using appropriate CSS Selectors to keep code concise.

## Usage
The Horiseon web page has three main navigational links:
- Search Engine Optimization
- Online Reputation Management
- Social Media Marketing

This can be seen in the screenshot below:

When each navigational link is clicked, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the webpage as shown below:
